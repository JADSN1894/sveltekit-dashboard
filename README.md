# SvelteKit Dashboard

This is Johnny's take on the [free Nextjs to SvelteKit](https://johnnify.com/learn/nextjs-to-sveltekit) course, which is a take on [Next/Learn](https://nextjs.org/learn) but implementing with SvelteKit!

## Livestreams

## Setup

Before anything, install dependencies with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

You will need a version of Node for that to work correctly. This project uses [Volta](https://volta.sh/), which will switch to the correct version of node for you, if you have it available!

## Developing

Start a development server with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
